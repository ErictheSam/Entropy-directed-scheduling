# Entropy-directed scheduling (EDS)

* This is the implement of Entropy-directed scheduling (EDS) algorithm for FPGA high-level synthesis (HLS). Our work has been contributed to ICCD 2018.
* Benchmarks for our experiments can be downloaded at https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/EXPRESS/benchmark/ .
* Execution details can be found in `main.cpp`.
